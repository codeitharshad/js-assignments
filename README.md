# JavaScript Assignments Repository

Welcome to the JavaScript Assignments Repository. This repository is organized with subdirectories named after specific dates. Each subdirectory contains the assignment corresponding to that date.

## Directory Structure

The repository follows a clear and consistent structure to help you locate and manage assignments efficiently. Each subdirectory is named using the format `DD-MM-YYYY` (Year-Month-Day), and it contains the assignment files for that specific date.
